\title{Check if an activity is absent from a case}
\usage{
absent(activity, n = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{activity}{The activity to check. Character vector of length one.}

\item{n}{n is the allowed number of occurences of the activity. E.g. n = 0 means the activity should be absent, n = 1 means it is allowed to occur once.}
}
\description{
The \code{absent} rule can be used to check whether an activity is absent in a case or not. The \code{n} parameter can be configured to create a different level of \emph{absence}.
When n = 0, an activity is not allowed to occur even a single time. The maximum number of times it is allowed to occur is \code{n}.
}
\examples{
library(bupaR)
library(eventdataR)

# Check for which patients the activity "MRI SCAN" is absent.
patients \%>\%
check_rule(absent("MRI SCAN"))

# Check for which patients the activity "Blood test"
# occurs maximum a single time, but not 2 times or more.
patients \%>\%
check_rule(absent("Blood test", n = 1))
